Visitor management system in c [for university]


# Introduction:

Visitor management system is a tool that help organizations create or carry out their visitor management policies. As companies realize the value of visitor management, many are upgrading from the paper and pen sign-in sheet to a digital visitor management system that can help them do much more.
We created a digital visitor management system by creating console application through the C Programming language. There will be two part in our application. The first part will be a part for the visitors as a Front-end and the second part is for the admin as a Back-end.

# Visitor:
There will be two options for the visitor in Front-end there are Enter and Exit. When the visitor chose Enter, he will get some options where the visitor will give information about himself and also about his meeting or the purpose of visiting, In the Exit option, the visitor will give his phone number by the phone number we will find him and make him exit.

# Admin
In the admin part, there will be two options, one is the Visitor list. The visitor will be on the list who has visited the company or is still in the meeting. Visitorâ€™s data will be visible to the admin through the Visitor list. Another option will be Setting, where company data will be saved like name, address etc.
